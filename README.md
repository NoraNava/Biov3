# Biov3
Team LUX work for Ventspils ITC 2019

We focus on the balance between mental and physical health. The game provides fun and encourages kids to keep their 
minds light until they get better. 

Game isn't that easy, put definitely possible to win in less than 10 minutes. 

We had sme trouble putting this project in this repository after the other one got kind of corrupted, we hope everything is ok now. 
First time GitHub users, though. If you might need an add or some different files, I'm always on the line.
